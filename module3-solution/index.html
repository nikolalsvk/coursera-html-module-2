          Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars).
          When the user clicks that button, a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated
          in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.) The dropdown menu should contain 3
          items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

          The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make
          sure the dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes it from
          the rest of the content.

          (Hint: See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar and Lecture 31 for
          examples on how to accomplish this.)


           Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within
          the browser window. You must use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.

          (Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see
          http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment.)


           Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take
          up the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for
          all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you
          can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something
          like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required
          to view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to
          distinguish it from the rest of the content. (Hint: don’t forget to have an
          element with a class=’container’ or class=’container-fluid’ wrapping your grid.
          Remember that to have the grid do something “always”, i.e., no matter what
          browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we want
          the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)


          Both the tablet view and the desktop view of what’s graded and required is the
          same. Here is the mockup illustration of the desktop & tablet version of the
          site (only required graded parts shown):
